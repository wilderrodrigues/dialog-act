## Setup

Install Poetry 2.1+ and Python 3.13.15.

To install PyEnv and Poetry, if necessary, please follow the official documentation:

* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
* [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).

```sh
pyenv install -s 3.13.15
pyenv global 3.13.15 # or local, if you do not want to mess with your environment. 
poetry env use "$(pyenv which python)"
poetry install
```

Run these commands from the project directory; `.python-version` selects the
project interpreter. Poetry creates the environment in `.venv`. No global
Python selection is required. Commit `poetry.lock` with the project.

## Commands

```sh
poetry run dialog-acts --help
poetry run dialog-acts train --help
poetry run dialog-acts eval --help
poetry run pytest
```

# Training the model

```sh
poetry run dialog-acts train ./data/dialog_acts.dat
```
